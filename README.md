# Machine Learning for Business 📊🤖

Welcome to the **Machine Learning for Business** course materials repository.  
This book is designed and maintained by **Dr. Chandravesh Chaudhari**, Assistant Professor at **Christ (Deemed to be University), India**.  

The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between **machine learning theory** and **real-world business applications**, providing learners with hands-on labs, case studies, and practical deployment workflows.
